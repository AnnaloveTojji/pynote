# pynote 
## by Abby
Hi!
I made this for my students. The main purpose of pynote is providing step-by-step python tutorial that anyone can follow and learn. If you are a coder starting python, I encourage you to run files in 'lab' folder and work on exercise problems.
# What's in this project
- 'lab': class materials
- 'soultion': basic problems and solutions in python 

### Have fun coding!
